# HIV Therapy Centre Analysis in India (2023)
A complete data analysis project on the distribution of HIV therapy centres across India using 2023 data. This project uses data cleaning, visualizations, dimensionality reduction (PCA), and clustering (KMeans) to uncover insights from the health infrastructure dataset.
## Project Objectives
- Analyze the spread of HIV-related healthcare centres across Indian states
- Visualize centre types and distribution
- Identify hidden patterns using PCA
- Group states with similar infrastructure using clustering
## Tech Stack

-Tools used
-Python
-Pandas, NumPy
-Matplotlib, Seaborn
-Scikit-learn


## Analysis Highlights

- Cleaned complex column names for better usability  
- Visualized ART and other centres by state and type  
- Used boxplots, pairplots, and heatmaps for data exploration  
- Applied *Principal Component Analysis* (PCA) to reduce dimensionality  
- Performed *KMeans Clustering* to categorize states with similar patterns  
- Generated summary statistics for each cluster group
